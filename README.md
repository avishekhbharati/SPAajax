# SPAajax

This is a simple Single Page Application in ASP.NET MVC using jquery and ajax. 
It is just for understanding how the SPA works. There is no validations performed 
in the client and server side. Add the validation logic as per your requirement.

Consists of a single Member model.  Code first approach has been used. 
It performs simple CRUD operation in the most elegant way without the need   
of switching through the pages. 

To install:
  * download the package.
  * add the necessary dependencies via nuget.
  * enable migarton, update database 
  * and you are good to go.
  
And yeah, modify web.config file as per reqn(like may be you wnat to create the database in SQL server
installed in the machine rather than in the local db).
